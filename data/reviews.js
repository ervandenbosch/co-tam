      "Visited last night, having tried their takeaway in the past. I have travelled to Vietnam and really love the cuisine. It's nice to hear that the owners here originate in Vietnam, and seem very sweet. Great service and a nice, relaxed atmosphere. For Haarlem, I really think you cannot find better. Co Tam truly exceeded my expectations, and the meal was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend. We'll be back again soon :)",

I would’ve appreciated some traditional Vietnamese drinks, but it’s not a deal breaker. Highly recommend you come here with friends and get the good seating by the windows.",
