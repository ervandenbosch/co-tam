It's nice to hear that the owners here originate in Vietnam, and seem very sweet. Great service and a nice, relaxed atmosphere. For Haarlem, I really think you cannot find better. Co Tam truly exceeded my expectations, and the meal was absolutely delicious! I highly recommend. We'll be back again soon :)",
