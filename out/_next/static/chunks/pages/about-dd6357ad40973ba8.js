One day she stumbled upon a beautiful restaurant location in Haarlem that was available. We immediately fell in love with it and we took a big leap of faith to open a restaurant during pandemic in a country we don't speak the language yet (we only speak Vietnamese and German, but learning English and Dutch!).
